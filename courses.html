            <div class="card card-body">
                This course introduces you to the basic concepts of object-oriented programming. You learn how to write simple but useful programs using Java, and attain a solid grasp of programming principles in general. The topics may include: different kinds of data: objects and values, variables and final variables, control structures: ifs and loops, how to search and sort data, how to write data to and from files on disks, how to use code that's already been written, i.e., inheritance, how to design elegant solutions to problems using a technique called recursion, etc.

            CMPUT 299 [Security in a Networked World]
        </button>

        <div class="collapse" id="course6">
            <div class="card card-body">
                The course provides an introduction to the security issues related to the design and operation of networked information systems. The network under study is our familiar TCP/IP-based Internet. We also consider specific end-user network access technologies, such as wireless local area networks. The systems studied provide services running on network nodes (web, login/shell, file sharing, etc.) that interact with other servers at other nodes, or, directly, with the end-users. We define the usual information assurance objectives (confidentiality, integrity, and authentication) and describe how they can be implemented. We review the sources of existing vulnerabilities, and the tools and techniques used to fix them, or to minimize their impact. Essentially the course presents concepts of TCP/IP networking, basic Operating System capabilities, and cryptography, that, when combined appropriately, provides the security objectives of large networked systems. The course is both an examination of the "arms race" of measures and counter-measures in the world of security, as well as an extensive introduction into what are current good practices for building secure systems.

        <div class="collapse" id="course7">
            <div class="card card-body">
                The course is an introductory course to the design of digital logic circuits. CMPUT 329 takes a two-pronged approach: an applied (laboratory) component and a theoretical (lecture) component. The lectures cover the basics of digital logic, combinational logic circuits, and sequential logic circuits. In the context of the course, Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) are introduced, and VHDL in particular, alongside with programmable hardware devices. VHDL is used extensively in the assignments/labs.

        <div class="collapse" id="course8">
            <div class="card card-body">
                The course provides an overview of the organization of operating systems for general-purpose computers. Students will be exposed to several new aspects of programming including: process scheduling, process synchronization, multi-process computation, deadlock avoidance, file system organization, and security. The concepts taught will be illustrated with examples taken from a variety of operating systems, but mostly from UNIX. The concepts covered are (quoted from the calendar description): Definition of a process; process states and state transitions; process control block; operations on processes; interrupt processing; parallel processing; resource allocation; shared and unshared allocation; critical sections; semaphores; deadlock; deadlock prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery; memory management; memory allocation schemes; virtual memory; paging and segmentation; page replacement strategies; working sets; demand paging; job and processor scheduling; scheduling levels, objectives, and criteria; various scheduling algorithms; multi-processor considerations; file system functions; file organization; tree structured file systems; space allocation; file catalogs; file access control mechanisms; operating systems security.

        <div class="collapse" id="course9">
            <div class="card card-body">
                An investigation of computer system design concepts including requirements, specifications, implementation and modification. Instruction sets, arithmetic/logic unit design, bus structures, I/O structures, control organization and implementation. Discussion and use of hardware description languages. It is not possible to cover in depth all the issues mentioned in the above description. The primary focus of our course will be high-performance aspects of CPU and I/O architecture, as perceived by a systems programmer. Even though the course heavily trespasses upon the ECE territory, being part of a computing science department, we shall look at things from the programmer's angle.

            CMPUT 640 [Resource Allocation in Networks]
        </button>

        <div class="collapse" id="course10">
            <div class="card card-body">
                This course focuses on a variety of methods for allocating resources in networks. One of the problems that can be solved with the tools we will look at is deciding how best to allocate network bandwidth amongst a group of concurrent users so as to minimize network congestion. Participants should have a first undergraduate course in convex optimization and probability. Some control theory will also be required, but the necessary background from that area will be covered during lectures. This is an area of very active research and there are a number of interesting open problems which could be studied. Most of the existing work focuses on pairs of communicating endpoints, whereas the trend in the Internet is towards multipoint and peer-to-peer interaction (multiplayer gaming, media sharing, etc.).

        </button>

        <div class="collapse" id="course11">
            <div class="card card-body">
                This practically-oriented course is an overview of medium access control (MAC) techniques for shared-media networks, including wired local area networks and wireless (also ad-hoc) networks. Our objective is to understand the principles and fundamental limitations of MAC-protocols with respect to the interesting measures of performance and fairness and formulate important design criteria leading to efficient and robust solutions. Our discussion will be based on numerous case studies. The protocols presented in class will be realistically programmed in SMURPH/SIDE - a software package for modeling networks and low-level protocols. This will be also our primary experimental platform for solving practical protocol design projects.

        <div class="collapse" id="course12">
            <div class="card card-body">
                The course aims at providing graduate students with suitable background to understand and pursue research work in the rapidly growing field of mobile wireless networks, and wireless enabled sensor networks. As such the course contents are organized around two complementary parts. One part emphasizes basic understanding of analytical tools with broad applications to the design, modelling, and performance evaluation of computer networks. The other part aims at providing basic understanding of the wireless communication technologies as they apply to the design of WLANs, WPANs, and cellular networks, as well as other issues particular to the wireless transport layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack.
